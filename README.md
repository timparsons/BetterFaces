# BetterFaces
A better JSF component library than what comes with Mojarra

### Why BetterFaces?
Do you use JSF, but want to use a component library that is light weight and makes things better?  Me too.

BetterFaces is just that, light weight, and makes things better.  Rather than adding new widgets and the like, BetterFaces renders HTML in a better way (i.e. not using tables to organize a radio group) that is in line with HTML standards.

### Sounds pretty cool...how do I use it?
Simple!  BetterFaces is a Maven project, so all you need to do is include it as a dependency in your JSF web application*:

```xml
<dependency>
  <groupId>io.timparsons</groupId>
  <artifactId>betterfaces</artifactId>
  <version>0.0.1</version>
</dependency>
```

*until this project is pushed to http://mvnrepository.com/, you will need to include the jar in your project TODO -> show how to do that
